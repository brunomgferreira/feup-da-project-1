This function calculates and displays the maximum flow for each city in the network.

Calculates the impact of each pipeline on the flow of delivery sites and saves the results to a CSV file. 

This function calculates the impact of each pipeline on the flow of delivery sites in the network. It creates a directory for the output file if it doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist and opens a CSV file to write the results. Then, it iterates through each pipeline in the network, temporarily taking each pipeline out of commission and recalculating the flow of delivery sites. It prints the impact of each pipeline on the flow of each delivery site to the console and writes the results to the CSV file. Finally, it closes the output file and displays the path to the file if it was successfully created.

Identifies the impact of all pumping stations on the network. 

This function simulates the impact of each pumping station on the network by temporarily deactivating each pumping station and evaluating the resulting flow changes at delivery sites. For each pumping station, it deactivates the station, calculates the new flow at each delivery site, and identifies any changes in flow compared to the original network. If there are changes in flow, indicating the impact of the pumping station, the function outputs the details including the pumping station code, city code, demand, old flow, and new flow to the console and optionally to a CSV file. Additionally, it creates an output directory if it doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist and saves the results in a CSV file. The function provides insights into the impact of each pumping station on the water flow to each city in the network.

Identifies essential pipelines for each city in the network. 

This function determines essential pipelines for each city by simulating the impact of deactivating each pipeline in the network. It iterates through each pipeline, temporarily deactivates it, and evaluates the resulting flow changes at delivery sites. If deactivating a pipeline causes a change in flow at a delivery site, indicating its essentiality, the pipeline is marked as essential for that city. The function then outputs the essential pipelines for each city to the console and optionally to a CSV file. Additionally, it creates an output directory if it doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist and saves the results in a CSV file. The function provides insights into which pipelines are essential for maintaining water flow to each city in the network.

Performs a load optimization on the network to improve the distribution of water resources. 

This function optimizes the load distribution in the network by adjusting the flow of water through different pipelines. It computes the initial metrics of the network and then applies optimization techniques to achieve better load balancing. After optimization, it calculates the final metrics and compares them with the initial metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization process.

Identifies pumping stations that are not essential for maintaining the current maximum flow in the network. 

This function analyzes each pumping station in the network to determine if it is essential for maintaining the current maximum flow. It deactivates each pumping station one by one and evaluates the total water supplied by the network. If the total water supplied remains equal to the current maximum flow after deactivating a pumping station, it indicates that the station is not essential for maintaining the current flow. The function outputs the codes of the pumping stations that are not essential to a CSV file and to the console. Additionally, it provides a note about the significance of essential pumping stations in maintaining the network\textquotesingle{}s flow.

Checks if a pipeline exists in the network. 

This function checks if a pipeline with the specified code exists in the network. It first searches for the pipeline in the map of pipelines. If found, it returns true.

Calculates the impact of a specific pipeline on the flow of delivery sites and network metrics. 

This function calculates the impact of a specific pipeline (identified by its code) on the flow of delivery sites and various network metrics. It retrieves information about the pipeline from the network\textquotesingle{}s data structure, such as its service points, directionality, and capacity. Then, it temporarily takes the pipeline out of commission in a copy of the network graph to simulate its impact. It iterates through each delivery site to determine the change in flow caused by deactivating the pipeline and prints this information to the console. Additionally, it calculates and displays total demand, current max flow, and total water supplied by other pipelines. It also provides insights into whether the network can meet its water needs without the pipeline and whether the pipeline is essential to maintain the current max flow.

Identifies the impact of a specific pumping station being out of commission. 

This function simulates the impact of a given pumping station being out of commission by deactivating the station and evaluating the resulting flow changes at each delivery site.

If there are changes in flow, indicating the impact of the pumping station, the function outputs the details including the city code, city name, demand, old flow, and new flow to the console. Additionally, it provides insights into the impact of the pumping station on the network\textquotesingle{}s ability to meet water demand and maintain the current maximum flow.
